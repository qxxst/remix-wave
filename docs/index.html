                        <p>This is my attempt to create a worthy Sonic Blaster sequel.</p>
                        <p class="qm-muted">It's actually just a preview, but you get the idea.</p>
                        <audio controls loop>

                        </audio>
                        <p>Yes, this is still being worked on. I just haven't changed it enough to justify uploading another preview yet.</p>

            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>Remix Wave is my remix, cover, or whatever else you'd like to call it, of F-777's song <i>Sonic Blaster</i>. I've been working on it for over a year, trying to fix and improve little bits of it all the time.</p>
                <div class="qm-video-container">
                    <video autoplay muted loop class="qm-video-background" style="filter: contrast(1.5) brightness(1.5) saturate(1.5) blur(5px) grayscale(100%);">
                        <source src="videos/background/swi-bloom-compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <h2>... Why?</h2>
                    <p>I love Sonic Blaster. It's been my favorite song of all time since I first heard it in 2018. It introduced me to an entire genre of music I didn't know I liked, and it helped motivate me to get good at Geometry Dash (even though I still suck at it). I've listened to it and its resulting variations - and played the levels using them - for hundreds of hours.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>How will this be different from ___'s remix/song?</h2>
                <p>It probably won't be. There are lots of remixes and other songs that could be considered Sonic Blaster "sequels", like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdZU4zoyEV8" target="_blank">Dual Mix</a>, <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/752906" target="_blank"><i>Sonic Blaster II</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkqa31Afres" target="_blank"><i>Cosmic Blaster</i></a>. And, of course, the HJFod remix, which has likely been the most popular of them all since it came out. F-777 also recently posted "Sonic Blaster 2.2" on <a href="https://x.com/F777_official/status/1691290885621977088" target="_blank">X</a>, which could be teasing a potential new Sonic Blaster song in the future.</p>
                <p>I don't want to compete with any of these. I think they're all great, and their creators are much more talented than I am. My only goal is to create a song that people would enjoy listening to.</p>
                <div class="qm-white">
                    <h2>When will it be out?</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure. I would describe its current state as "almost done", but I've been saying that for months now. I originally thought it could be done in a few days, but every time I think it's close to being finished, there's something I want to add or change.</p>
                    <p>At this point, there is no final deadline. I won't release it until I'm satisfied with it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qm-video-container">
                    <video autoplay muted loop class="qm-video-background" style="filter: contrast(1.5) brightness(1.5) saturate(1.5) blur(5px);">
                        <source src="videos/background/paradox-loop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <h2>Can I use it for ___?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. In addition to making the song free to download and use for any (reasonable) purpose, I will also make each track's individual stems and MIDI files publicly available so that people can create their own deviations of it.</p>
                    <p>In terms of copyright, Remix Wave is 100% independent from Sonic Blaster. No copyrighted sounds or samples from Sonic Blaster are used in Remix Wave. Even the main loops have been changed to create a new, unique theme. You will not receive a copyright strike for using this song on YouTube or any other platform.</p>
                    <p>I probably need to create a detailed license in the future just to be safe, but the rules will be pretty simple. Don't try to sell Remix Wave or claim to be the creator of it.</p>

                    <video autoplay muted loop class="qm-video-background" style="filter: contrast(1.5) brightness(1.5) saturate(1.5) blur(5px) grayscale(100%) invert(1);">

                    <h2>Can I use it in Geometry Dash?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, but you need to add it to your game manually. I won't be publishing the song on Newgrounds - <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1419782" target="_blank">it probably wouldn't be accepted anyway</a> - but you can still use it in your <i>local</i> Geometry Dash client by renaming the file to "574484.mp3" and replacing the original Sonic Blaster file in your songs folder with the remix.</p>
                    <p>If you don't know how to do all of that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ty6fwJUaVo" target="_blank">this video</a> can show you. It is accurate as of 2.1. It may not be accurate as of 2.2.</p>
                    <p>Remix Wave has the same tempo as Sonic Blaster (145 BPM), and each section is the same respective length. It will be fully compatible with all existing Sonic Blaster levels (provided the levels themselves are correctly synced to the music).</p>
